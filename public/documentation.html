    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>
      To build the server-side component of a “movies” web application.
    </p>
    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p> The web application will provide users with access to information about different
      movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their
      personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.
